# Vegan food shop!

Educational project with stack that was configured to
use all packages I didn't use at main work

### Technologies:

`React 18` (ejected and upgraded 'create react app')

`Redux`

`Scss` (ofc I used it before, but css-in-js is the main way of writing css for me for a long time, so it's time to refresh sass knowledge)

`RX js`

`Typescript` (I just don't want to use regular js :-> )

`Jest`

`React-router` (Instead of Next's `@reach/router`)

`Got`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
