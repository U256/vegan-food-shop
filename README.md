Educational project with stack that was configured to
use all packages I didn't use at main work

### Technologies:

`React 18` (ejected and upgraded 'create react app')

`Redux`

`Scss` (ofc I used it before, but css-in-js is the main way of writing css for me for a long time, so it's time to refresh sass knowledge)

`RX js`

`Typescript` (I just don't want to use regular js :-> )

`Jest`

`React-router` (Instead of Next's `@reach/router`)

`Got`
